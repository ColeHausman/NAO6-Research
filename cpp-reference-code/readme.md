### How To Run
If you already have your qibuild configured and toolchain linked just run:\
`qibuild init` && `qibuild configure` \
If you don't know what this means head over to the C++ installation guide in the root of this repo \
Then run:\
`qibuild make` \
Finally:
`./build-<your config name>/sdk/bin/main <robot IP>`
